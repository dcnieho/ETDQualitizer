This folder contains the Validator module. It can be run standalone using the ``run_for_eyelink.py``,  ``run_for_eyelink.py`` or  ``run_for_eyelink.py`` scripts, or the  ``validator.py`` module can be imported and its ``validator.run_validation()`` function run at the appropriate time(s) in an existing PsychoPy script.

For further documentation, such as how to configure the fixation target display, see [this repository's readme](../../../master/README.md).
